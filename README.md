# horiseon-code-refactor

## Description

This undertaking involves restructuring the code for the Horiseon website homepage. The primary objectives of this refactoring are to enhance the efficiency, clarity, and accessibility of the existing code. Additionally, the refactoring aims to optimize search engine performance. It's important to note that these modifications do not alter the visual styling of the page; rather, they focus solely on improving the underlying code.

### Tasks completed

* Merged redundant classes for simplification.
* Substituted HTML elements with semantic counterparts.
* Introduced alt text for images to enhance accessibility.
* Incorporated comments within the HTML document for clarity.
* Restructured CSS to adhere to a more logical organization.
* Implemented a descriptive title for improved context.
